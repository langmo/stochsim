	/// <summary>
	/// A choice is a special kind of state. A call to Add does not increase the concentration of the choice. Instead, the boolean formula
	/// associated with this choice is evaluated. Depending on the outcome of this evaluation, either the concentrations of one or the other set of element states is increased according to their
	/// stochiometry. The same holds for Remove and Transform. 
	/// The typical use case is to use a Choice to implement conditionals for reactions. For example, a reaction might result in a product B with a certain probability, and in a product C with another, i.e.
	///      { B     if rand()>0.2
	/// A -> {
	///      { C     otherwise.
	/// This would then be implemented as a propensity reaction with A as the reactant, and a choice as the product. The boolean formula associated to the choice would be "rand()>0.2", the first set of
	/// products of the choice would contain only B with stochiometry 1, and the second set only C with stochiometry 1.
	/// The usage of a choice becomes specifically interesting when combined with reactions providing additional information (variables) which can be used in the boolean expression. For example, a delay
	/// reaction passes the number of how often its (sole) reactant was transformed.
	/// To be compatible with mass action kinetics, the concentration of a choice (Num()) is calculated as follows: First, the boolean expression is evaluated. Then,
	/// either only the elementsIfTrue, or the elementsIfFalse are considered based on the outcome of the evaluation of the condition. The return value is then the product
	/// of these elements, according to their stochiometry. That is, if the choice is between 2*A+C and 3*D, we return A*(A-1)*C if the choice condition evaluates to true, and D*(D-1)*(D-2) if not.
